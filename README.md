# Basic Ionic App

This repo was created to demonstrate the easy of creating an Ionic Hybrid App.  
This app is more than a *"hello world app"*, we'll be exploring some features and components that we use in real-life projects.  

Here, we'll be exploring:

- Real-life app layout
- HTTP Requests
- Cordova plugins to abstract the communication between our hybrid code and the device's APIs
